					<p>Taste shouldn’t be the only thing you appreciate while enjoying our beer. Our food scientists are always hard at work developing new tastes to bring to our beer. They just so happened to discover a new technology that can make your clothes smell great, without sacrificing taste. That’s right! BECK’S® still has the same great taste with the added benefit of smelling great! The obvious answer was to team up with Renuzit® Brand Snuggle® Fabric Refresher, the professionals of fresh smelling clothes. We knew immediately we had to get this new beer into the hands of our customers with the highest standard of taste and smell.</p>

			<span id="pageTitle">F.A.Q.</span>
		<p>Q: Does the beer taste like the “aromas” advertised?</p>
		
		<p>A: No! The aromas are more descriptions of how your clothes will smell as you enjoy our product. All of our BECK’S® & Renuzit® Snuggle® products come with the same great taste as the original BECK’S® beer brand. The only choice you need to make is how you want your clothes to smell. The only addition you’ll notice is cleaner, fresher, smelling clothes!</p>

		<p>Q: Is it safe to drink?</p>

		<p>A: The BECK’S® & Renuzit® Snuggle® beer has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). It is 100% safe for consumption and we know you’ll love the fresh scents it brings!</p>

		<p>Q: This sounds impossible, how does it work?</p>

		<p>A: A good magician never reveals their tricks, and a good company never reveals their trade secrets. What we can tell you is that our technology has no effect on taste or nutritional contents. It facilitates the body's natural occurring mechanisms to administer the fresh smelling compounds to be absorbed into and released from the clothes you’re wearing. </p>

		<p>Q: Where can I buy BECK’S® & Renuzit® Snuggle® beer?</p>

		<p>A: We are aiming to have our products everywhere domestic beer is sold. If you haven’t refreshed yourself, refreshingly, yet; head to your local beer retailer and see what all the hype is about!</p>
